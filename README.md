 NO-SQL VS SQL?
 Data Integrity?
 Migrations?
 Constraints?
 Stored Procedures?
 Triggers?


Note: How does it all work in NO-SQL env??

History of Relational (AKA "SQL") Database..
Storing Data < Processing... 


**SQL.                  
Slower.                 
Rigid Structure enforce integirty of data                         
Run computations or calucation using SQL or data script                       
                        
                

**NO-SQL.
Faster
Data is  stored in shape needed
No join = faster fetching 
No Migration or schema changes needed

Array Data Structure.............

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
